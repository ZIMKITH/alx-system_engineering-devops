A postmortem (or post-mortem) is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.

Postmortems typically involve blame-free analysis and discussion soon after an incident or event has taken place. An artifact is produced that includes a detailed description of exactly what went wrong in order to cause the incident, along with a list of steps to take in order to prevent a similar incident from occurring again in the future. An analysis of how your incident response process itself worked during the incident should also be included in the discussion. The value of postmortems comes from helping institutionalize a culture of continuous improvement. This way, teams are better prepared when another incident inevitably occurs with mission- or business-critical systems.

As your systems scale and become more complex, failure is inevitable, assessment and remediation is more involved and time-consuming, and it becomes increasingly painful to repeat recurring mistakes. Not having data when you need it is expensive.

Streamlining the postmortem process is key to helping your team get the most from their postmortem time investment: spending less time conducting the postmortem, while extracting more effective learnings, is a faster path to increased operational maturity. In fact, the true value of postmortems comes from helping institutionalize a positive culture around frequent and iterative improvement.

The benefits of an incident postmortem
You may be tempted to skip a formal incident postmortem meeting and write-up, especially if you are certain of what caused the incident, and you’re pretty sure you’ve fixed the issue. 

That may be true—for you. But there may be people on your team who haven’t internalized what happened to cause the incident and could benefit from your clear understanding and improve their service to the team—and your customers. 

Bringing people together to engage in a structured, collaborative process allows everyone to contribute what they learned and can build trust and resiliency within your team. And documenting the incident and how the team remedied it can inform how future incidents are handled. 

You may also decide to publish takeaways from your incident postmortem with customers or the rest of your organization. This can go a long way in rebuilding confidence in people who may not have been closely involved as the incident was happening. Other teams in your organization, especially leadership, may need to see the details of the problem and what steps were taken to resolve it to head off any second-guessing of your team in the future. 

Partners, customers, and end-users may also want to know what happened and what steps you have taken to improve their experience. Making your incident postmortem available on your public-facing website may not be appropriate in all cases, but your marketing or public relations team can help you craft the language so people get the information in a way that is informative and builds trust in your service.
